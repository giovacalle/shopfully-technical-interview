# Overview

This repository contains the code for the Shopfully technical interview. The goal of this exercise is to create a simple web application that allows users to search for products and view product details.

Inside the `guidelines/Exercise.pdf` you will find major details about the application and the mockups.

## Requirements

- The application should be written in React or Backbone (frontend).
- The application should be written in Node.js, PHP or .NET (backend).
- The application should be written with a css library between Bootstrap, Material UI, or Semantic UI.
- Follow the mockups provided in the `guidelines/Mockup` directory.
- The application should be responsive.

## Instructions

In order to show products to the user, you will need to create a backend that will fetch products from the csv file provided in the `guidelines` directory.
The frontend should be able to fetch the products from the backend and display them in the results page.

## Bonus

- Add 'add to favorites' functionality to the product details page and display them in the sidebar.
- Products are shown in lazy loading when user scrolls down the page.
